### **📌 Projects I've Worked On:**  
- **🌐 Full-Stack Web App with Live Server Integration**
  - Designed and developed a website connected to a live server.
  -  Implemented backend functionality that updated the server in real time with user inputs, demonstrating practical experience in database management,server communication, and backend integration.
- **🌦 Weather Prediction Model:**  
  - Used **37 features** from historical city data (1970–present) to predict the next day's **average temperature**.  
  - The model can be adjusted to predict multiple days ahead with minor modifications.  
- **📊 Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews:**  
  - Trained a model on an **IMDB dataset of labeled words/word embeddings** to classify reviews as **positive or negative**.  
  - Leveraged NLP techniques to extract sentiment patterns from text.  
- **🖼 CIFAR-10 Image Classification:**  
  - Built a model to classify images into one of **10 categories**: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.  
- **✍ MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition:**  
  - Developed a model to recognize and classify **handwritten digits** from images.  
- **More Projects Coming Soon:**  
  - I continuously work on **new projects** and update my repositories for anyone interested.
